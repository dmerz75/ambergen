AMBER Steered Molecular Dynamics

quick description:
 -steered molecular dynamics with AMBER
 -obtaining the PMF stretching a peptide

more details:
 -take 1 peptide, with a .prmtop, .inpcrd (equilibrated), and smd.in (as template),
  for any solvent conditions, vacuum, implicit, or explicit, and generate a
  project directory, for exploring multiple pulling velocities, all from 
  1 script
 -generates an array of directories designed for quick acquisition of 
  a virtually unlimited number of trajectories
 
steps/commands:
 1) ./setup.py    # create the working directory
 2) upload the directory onto a cluster 
 3) ./run.py      # submits jobs to the PBS resource manager
